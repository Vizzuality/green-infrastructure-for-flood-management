  title: 'Risk Assessment and Range of Solutions',
  text: [
    'Implementation of nature-based measures for flood risk management should start with a thorough risk assessment and evaluation of the full range of possible measures.',
    `Flood risk management projects generally start with the identification of the three elements of risk: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability (IPCC 2014, Sendai 2015). Conducting a risk assessment has two main purposes: first, it provides a baseline understanding of what is at stake, and enables the decision maker to define a risk reduction target, and thus an acceptable level of residual risk; second, it is an important basis for analyzing the effectiveness of the various measures available for risk reduction.
    Risk assessments are not always executed in projects that aim for implementation of nature-based solutions, which may result in a lack of understanding of the project target and in the amount of risk reduced. In addition, the wide portfolio of measures for flood risk reduction is not always taken into account in these projects. This may lead to implementation of suboptimal solutions in critical places or to ill-fitted risk management strategies with potential long-term negative impacts for risk, ecosystems or other community interests. There are standardized methods for risk assessment that will allow inclusion of nature-based solutions as a possible strategy for reducing risk. Applying such standardized methods will aid implementation of the best measures in the best place. Risk assessments should incorporate projections of future changes in risk due to climatic and socioeconomic changes, and should also account for the dynamic nature of the risk reduction functions of natural ecosystems and the evolution of ecosystem services over time. Additional analyses should quantify ecosystem co-benefits in existing and future cost-benefit analyses. These analyses, in addition to risk assessment, should provide a good selection of options to make a decision on whether to implement nature-based solutions.`

  title: 'Standardized performance evaluation',
  text: [
    'Nature-based solutions for flood risk management need to be tested, designed, and evaluated, using the same criteria as hard engineering structures.',
    `For design and functioning of hard engineering structures, criteria are determined and consolidated in manuals and guidelines.
    To determine effectiveness of nature-based interventions that aim to reduce hazard or exposure or are chosen as an alternative to structural measures, and to enable comparison with hard or gray engineered interventions, nature-based solutions must be held to measurable standards. There are several knowledge gaps regarding the performance of nature-based interventions for flood risk management. These gaps are mostly related to their performance under extreme conditions (e.g. with storms or tsunamis) and their persistence on longer time-scales under multiple events. For engineered structures there are international standards, such as the levee manual[1] and the Coastal Engineering Manual[2], that are followed for design, testing, and construction. These manuals provide guidance for implementation but also for testing of effectiveness. Similar standards for nature-based structures are not yet available, but standardized design criteria will rapidly advance as current knowledge gaps are filled. In addition, generic functional parameters for different habitat types can potentially be developed and captured in manuals (e.g. minimum and maximum dissipation coefficients for habitat types or species). In addition, developing and applying measurable engineering protocols to ecosystems will require close collaboration between ecologists and engineers. Doing this will increase our understanding of the role that ecosystems can play in risk reduction and ultimately allow for impartial comparison of effectiveness, costs, and benefits of different types of solutions.`

  title: 'Integration with ecosystem conservation and restoration',
  text: [
    'Nature-based solutions for flood risk management should make use of existing ecosystems and native species, and comply with basic principles of ecological restoration and conservation.',
    `Restoration, conservation, and management of ecosystems will constitute a crucial element of implementation of nature-based solutions for flood risk management.
    Ecological conservation and restoration is a scientific discipline with a large body of theory and practice. However, this knowledge is not always integrated in on-the-ground-project implementation. For example, large-scale mangrove planting efforts are often executed with unsuitable species in unsuitable areas and therefore fail unnecessarily. Moreover, poorly planned restoration and planting efforts may result in unanticipated effects on other valuable ecosystems, such as intertidal flats and seagrass beds. Restoration practices, similar to risk assessments, should start with a system evaluation to determine the type of ecosystem that used to exist and to identify limiting factors for the restoration of existing ecosystem elements or the construction of new ones.  On-the-ground project efforts can then mostly focus on mitigating those limiting factors or working within or expected constraints. Once abiotic conditions for ecosystem recovery are restored, planting is mostly not needed. Making use of available knowledge on ecosystem restoration and management will not only reduce the risk of failure in project implementation, but also avoid undesirable replacement or destruction of other valuable ecosystems for a nature-based flood risk reduction project. For example, in many countries mangroves are considered crucial for reduction of waves that are generated by coastal storms. However, often mangrove habitat, the upper intertidal area, is already used for fish and shrimp farming, agriculture, or for living. Therefore, mangrove restoration is often executed in the lower intertidal, negatively impacting shellfish, birds, seagrasses, and dugongs that live there. Such tradeoffs need to be anticipated so that communities are aware of both risk reduction outcomes and food security and ecological implications.`

  title: 'Considering risk at the right scale',
  text: [
    'To use the full potential of nature-based solutions, a long time frame and landscape perspective should be adopted in making the case for solutions, as well as in the design.',
    `For shoreline communities affected by flooding the threat is increasing due to changes in watershed land cover, land-use regimes, more intense precipitation, sea-level rise and increased storminess.
    Hard structures put in place to reduce flood risk are often not maintained or upgraded and therefore no longer effective in many areas. Reducing risk needs to consider the system being protected, the range of conditions that can occur and how systems change over time. For example, many coastal Louisiana residents say they have never flooded from storms before, not realizing their coast is changing, sea level is rising, and that each storm is different in track, size and intensity. Considering the scale of the problem and how it will change over time is essential. If evaluated on small spatial scales, such as a single wetland in front of a levee, at a single moment in time, the impact of nature-based solutions on risk reduction may seem minor. However, ecosystems build up over decades or even centuries and may thereby exceed the design lifetime of engineered structures. Ecosystems are also highly dependent on the larger enabling environment, and cannot often be sustained by managing individual sites in isolation. The integrity and health of larger ecosystems at landscape or delta scales therefore determines the potential of nature-based solutions to help limit flood risk. Consequently, to appreciate and fully develop the potential of nature-based solutions for flood risk reduction, these solutions should be evaluated and assessed on their potential over large spatial and temporal scales. This automatically implies that construction and maintenance of ecosystems at these scales must often happen in a ‘hybrid’ manner, meaning that they go beyond traditional restoration alone and could make use of more engineered methods and interventions, such as river diversions and sediment nourishments for longer term maintenance. This requires large-scale system knowledge, modelling and adequate design prior to project implementation.`

  title: 'Adaptive management',
  text: [
    'Nature-based solutions for flood risk management need adaptive management to ensure their sustainable performance.',
    `Just like engineering measures for flood risk management, nature-based solutions require maintenance after initial development to secure their long-term risk reduction potential.
    The dynamic nature of ecosystems combined with long-term trends and extensive risks, such as sea level rise and coastal development, asks for adaptive management of ecosystem-based strategies. The adaptive management cycle is built on a predictive outcome or target and consists of implementation, monitoring, data evaluation, and then adjustment of possible management measures. This cycle must be repeated with a fixed time interval for the full performance period of the measure. Adaptive management activities should be defined in a specific plan with funding available over time. These should include multiple management options in case of lack of expected performance of the implemented measure. For flood risk reduction this must include modeling as well as monitoring as the system should meet the criteria for risk reduction whenever the risk occurs. The adaptive management cycle should ensure consistent maintenance and development after project implementation and consolidate knowledge on effective measures and management methods.`
