    'Implementation of nature-based measures for flood risk management should start with a thorough risk assessment and evaluation of the full range of possible measures.',
    `Flood risk management projects generally start with the identification of the three elements of risk: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability (IPCC 2014, Sendai 2015). Conducting a risk assessment has two main purposes: first, it provides a baseline understanding of what is at stake, and enables the decision maker to define a risk reduction target, and thus an acceptable level of residual risk; second, it is an important basis for analyzing the effectiveness of the various measures available for risk reduction.
    Risk assessments are not always executed in projects that aim for implementation of nature-based solutions, which may result in a lack of understanding of the project target and in the amount of risk reduced. In addition, the wide portfolio of measures for flood risk reduction is not always taken into account in these projects. This may lead to implementation of suboptimal solutions in critical places or to ill-fitted risk management strategies with potential long-term negative impacts for risk, ecosystems or other community interests. There are standardized methods for risk assessment that will allow inclusion of nature-based solutions as a possible strategy for reducing risk. Applying such standardized methods will aid implementation of the best measures in the best place. Risk assessments should incorporate projections of future changes in risk due to climatic and socioeconomic changes, and should also account for the dynamic nature of the risk reduction functions of natural ecosystems and the evolution of ecosystem services over time. Additional analyses should quantify ecosystem co-benefits in existing and future cost-benefit analyses. These analyses, in addition to risk assessment, should provide a good selection of options to make a decision on whether to implement nature-based solutions.`
